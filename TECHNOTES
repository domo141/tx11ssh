Brief(?) tech notes
===================

tl;dr
-----

Run `tx11ssh --ll 4 remote` and observe the output while running
X applications -- and after a while doing so continue reading...


fd's used (in tx11ssh process)
------------------------------

local-server
''''''''''''
0: stdin
1: stdout
2: stderr
3: ssh connection
4: server unix domain socket

local-display
'''''''''''''
0: stdin
1: stdout
2: stderr
3: ssh connection
4: /dev/null

remote-server
'''''''''''''
0: ssh connection
1: ssh connection
2: stderr to ssh connection
3: /dev/null
4: server unix domain socket

remote-display
''''''''''''''
0: ssh connection
1: ssh connection
2: stderr to ssh connection
3: /dev/null
4: /dev/null


Fd's 5 - 255 are for channels. channel-fd mapping is kept by using dup2()
and close() (see display_handle_server_message() for plug trick)


Thoughts of flow control
------------------------

Flow control is not implemented; if an application (or X server) does
not read it's input buffer tx11ssh will block for maximum of 10 seconds
(after that the offending fd/channel is closed). During that 10 second
period 1/10 second sleep is executed (max) 100 times and after each
sleep the write to the application is attempted. POLLOUT poll(2) for
the socket may not work as expected if there were space for less than
the data attempted POLLOUT may be returned but write could fail returning
-1 (again and again).

By default the socket buffer is quite large. On linux ~120 000 bytes and
cygwin (some unix socket emulation) ~200 000 bytes; probably when all
processes get fair amount of processing time the traffic will never block...

The usock-buffer-test will write data to unix domain socket, with no
reader. It continues to write until full write could not be done anymore.

linux$ ./usock-buffer-test 4545
..........................
wrote 118170 bytes. last write: -1 (26.00 * 4545)
linux$ ./usock-buffer-test 4544
...........................
wrote 122688 bytes. last write: -1 (27.00 * 4544)

cygwin$ ./usock-buffer-test 4313
..............................................
wrote 198398 bytes. last write: -1 (46.00 * 4313)
cygwin$ ./usock-buffer-test 4544
...............................................
wrote 202664 bytes. last write: -1 (47.00 * 4312)


... running tx11ssh with default verbosity level 2 it will output info
whenever there was need to wait. With verbosity level 4 (--ll 4) tx11ssh
outputs sizes of all reads coming from ssh and application. If need arises
this can be used to determine whether more effort implementing flow
control is beeded.

First, sent & received counters needs to be added and peers ack the
amount of data received -- if there is too much unacked data sent,
more data from application is not read (so one channel cannot fill
the pipe).

This doesn't solve the blocking issue... In case write returns with
partial (or -- normally -- zero) write, the data in question is copied
to temporary buffer and writes are tried later. Acks are naturally not
sent to this chennel until data can be written again).
